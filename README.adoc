= smalldata

The intent od this utility is to have it extract and damp data encoded in various formats from its input.

It does not expect an entire file to be in the same format, but just searches for mating data and outputs it.

Initialy it supports base64. So you should be able to feed it a file or stdin
containing multiple chunks of base64 data and it will decode and output it.
